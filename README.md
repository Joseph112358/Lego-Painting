# Lego-Painting-System

This project aims to generate Lego paintings similar to the official Lego Elvis Presley one seen [here](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/elvis-presley-the-king-31204)


I don't have an "MVP" in mind yet, but I do have some rouph project goals and milestones.

<h2> Project goals</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Users should be able to input an image, which will output a list of the parts they need to construct the image, with corresponding locations for the pieces (later I may generate an instruction manual)</li>
    <li>The parts picked should link the corresponding store page. </li> 
    <li>An estimation of the cost of the pieces for the image (plus the frame) should be generated. Initially I can set these prices manually, but in the future it would be good to get them from the website. </li>
    <li>Render an image of what the picture might look like</li>
    <li>Generate an instruction manual</li>
    <li>Allow users to generate bigger paintings (for the larger frame)</li>
</ul>

<h2> Current objectives </h2>
<ul>
    <li> - [ ] "Compress" image to fit correct resolution</li>
    <li> - [ ] Create a list of valid lego parts / colors</li>
    <li> - [ ] map pixels to correct colors </li>
    <li> - [ ] Pick and create task management system (so I don't have to use the README) </li>
</ul>
